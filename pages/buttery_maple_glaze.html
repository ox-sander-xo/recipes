        <h2>Descrption</h2>
        <p>All you need to do is melt some butter, then whisk in some real maple syrup (it’s got the BEST texture and flavor!), powdered sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of cinnamon and salt. Now that you know how easy it is to make, you can understand why I’ve been making it nonstop! And, if you tasted it, you’d be hooked too.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Tbs Salted Butter (Melted)</li>
            <li>2 Tbs Maple Syrup</li>
            <li>1 Cup Powdered Sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of Cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the Glaze: Melt butter. Whisk in the maple syrup, then whisk in the remaining ingredients. If you want to thin this out more to create a thin glaze for things like apple fritters or donuts, add 2 tbsp milk.</li>
            <li>Serve + Store: Use on everything - donuts, scones, muffins, as a fruit dip, with caramel sauce, or just drink it plain, hehe. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
