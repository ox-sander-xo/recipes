    <h2>Descrption</h2>
    <p>This is an easy Thai chicken curry that’s made in one skillet, ready in 20 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coconut Oil</li>
        <li>Sweet Vidalia Onion</li>
        <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Ground Coriander</li>
        <li>Canned Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>Shredded Carrots</li>
        <li>Thai Red Curry Paste </li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Lime Juice</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and sauté over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; stir intermittently.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir frequently.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk, carrots, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 5 minutes, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach, lime juice, and stir to combine. Cook until spinach has wilted and is tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and optionally add brown sugar, additional curry paste, salt, pepper, etc. to taste.</li>
        <li>Evenly sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Curry is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
